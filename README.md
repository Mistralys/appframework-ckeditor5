# Application Framework CKEditor5 build

CKEditor5 build for the [Application Framework][]'s default markup editor.

> This is based on a CKEditor5 editor build generated by the 
  [Online builder tool][], with some adjustments to make it work with
  the framework's MarkupEditor classes.

## Working principle

The file `src/ckeditor.js` is the configuration for the editor build.
This contains the list of plugins that will be available in the editor,
and that can be enabled at will with the markup editor's methods.

The configuration file is used to compile everything into a single 
JavaScript file, from the source code to CSS and image files. This can
then be included to create Editor instances for Text Area form elements.

## Quick start

Open the `sample/index.html` page in the browser to check out the default
editor settings.

## Development and build

### Installation

In order to rebuild the application you need to install all dependencies 
first. To do it, open the terminal in the project directory and type:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### Build files

To generate the production file `build/ckeditor.js`:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Publish to framework

Copy the contents of the `build` folder to the framework, at this location:

```
src/themes/default/js/markup-editor/ckeditor/build
```
